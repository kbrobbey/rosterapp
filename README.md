# RosterApp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Project Overview

This app is a simple draft app, that allows users to draft robots into a team.
A team consists of 12 robots subdivided into two categories: Bench and Starters.  
A Bench at most can have 7 robots and the Starters at most can have 5 robots.  
Once a users starts the app by running ‘npm run start’, they will be directed to the local host page. Upon initial load, a robot card will be ready to be drafted with options to be drafted to the team, either to the Bench or Starters. When ‘Bench’ is clicked, the selected robot is added to the Bench, conversely when ‘Start’ is clicked the selected robot is added to the Starters. Once a robot is added to the team, they can be moved around, by clicking the options below the robot card.

- If user clicks ‘Demote’, the selected robot is moved from Starters to Bench.

- If user clicks ‘Promote’ the selected robot is moved from Bench to Starters.

- If user clicks ‘Release’, the robot is kicked off the team.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run prettier`

Launches prettier to follow AirBnB coding style syntax

### `npm run lint`

Launches eslint to check for any semantical errors

### `npm run storybook`

Launches storybook to run tests on components

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
